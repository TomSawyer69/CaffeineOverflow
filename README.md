A ios based app to link sustainable businesses

SUS.
Despite an increase in the number of sustainable companies, consumers are
unable to find suitable sustainable products near them. Moreover, there is a
dearth of platforms for sustainable businesses to collaborate and connect.
Thus there is a need for a platform that brings sustainable businesses and
customers together. This is SUS.

Our app SUS. is built on a simple, but powerful vision: A world where
shopping doesn't come at the expense of the environment, people or animals.
This iOS app, SUS. , provides a platform for consumers to find sustainable
products near their homes. SUS. is a free app to shop with accredited
sustainable brands and live a more environmentally considerate lifestyle.
From clothes to organic groceries, we provide you a list of businesses that
manufacture sustainable products you need.
